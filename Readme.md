Before running the file, create a folder and place the "main.py" and "logic.py" files inside.

To run the file, you just need to have Python installed on the operating system and use a code editor to run the game or in the terminal itself.

<h3>Starting</h3>

To run it in the terminal, type "python -V" and see the version of python installed on your OS. If the version appears, it means it is installed. In the terminal, go to the folder where the file is and type:

If you are using Windows/Mac os:
```bash
py main.py
```
or
```bash
python main.py
```

If you are using Linux:
```bash
python3 main.py
